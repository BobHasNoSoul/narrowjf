A thin.. very thin.. webclient designed for potato clients like some old first gen smart tvs.. simply run this in a server and add it to a subdomain and then connect the potato client to it.. mininal loading easy to use.


this is created to fix a use case for my sisters tv.. it was an older pos that needed a client that could run without crashing the browser on it.. there was no app store so i made this to fix the issue 

put the files on your linux server (or windows and just run the python script) and run the bash script background.sh to background it for you on linux.
